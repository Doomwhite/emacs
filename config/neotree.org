* NEOTREE
Neotree is a file tree viewer.  When you open neotree, it jumps to the current file thanks to neo-smart-open.  The neo-window-fixed-size setting makes the neotree width be adjustable.  NeoTree provides following themes: classic, ascii, arrow, icons, and nerd.  Theme can be configed by setting "two" themes for neo-theme: one for the GUI and one for the terminal.  I like to use 'SPC t' for 'toggle' keybindings, so I have used 'SPC t n' for toggle-neotree.

| COMMAND        | DESCRIPTION               | KEYBINDING |
|----------------+---------------------------+------------|
| neotree-toggle | /Toggle neotree/            | SPC t n    |
| neotree- dir   | /Open directory in neotree/ | SPC d n    |
