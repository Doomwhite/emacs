Display the actual color as a background for any hex color value (ex. #ffffff).  The code block below enables rainbow-mode in all programming modes (prog-mode) as well as org-mode, which is why rainbow works in this document.  

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package rainbow-mode
    :diminish
    :hook 
    ((org-mode prog-mode) . rainbow-mode))
#+end_src
