This is just an example of how to create a simple function in Emacs.  Use this function to reload Emacs after adding changes to the config.  Yes, I am loading the user-init-file twice in this function, which is a hack because for some reason, just loading the user-init-file once does not work properly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun reload-init-file ()
  (interactive)
  (load-file user-init-file)
  (load-file user-init-file))
#+end_src
