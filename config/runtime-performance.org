Dial the GC threshold back down so that garbage collection happens more frequently but in less time. We also increase Read Process Output Max so emacs can read more data.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Make gc pauses faster by decreasing the threshold.
  (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 2 1000 1000))
  ;; Increase the amount of data which Emacs reads from the process
  (setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024)) ;; 1mb
#+end_src
